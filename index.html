    <h3>Menstrual Health</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid rgb(2, 0, 0);">
  Each day, some 800 million people between the ages of 15 - 49 are menstruating. Yet for so many, a natural biological process spells more than a monthly inconvenience. 
        In some countries, menstruation is taboo or riddled with myths, and women and girls are excluded from daily activities because of stigma, shame or discrimination or because they are considered unclean. 
        Many young women and girls in India suffer due to poverty, and this makes their lives even harder when it comes to the time of their menstrual period. 
        As a result, people are often fearful and unprepared when they start having periods. 
        They cannot afford sanitary pads and other items, and so stay away from school during this time, or even end up dropping out completely. They need help!    
    </p>
    <h1 style="padding:10px; ">
        It's high time we should normalize period talk!

    <h2> Taboos and myths about menstruation</h2>
    <p>
        Even though the year is 2022, more than half the population has got it wrong about periods. Upon being asked about menstruation, these are a few of the things that people said.<br>

        “Women use menstruation as an excuse to shield their irritation and win fights.” <br>Let me tell you what a person goes through during their period, mood swings, bloating, breakouts, cramps, muscle aches, joint pain, nausea, and a lot more.<br> If you think people use menstruation as an excuse, you're wrong. At times, it takes courage to even get out of bed.

        <br>“A woman is impure when she is bleeding.” <br>Any person who bleeds is not impure, they just go through a natural biological process which is the doorway of a new life.<br>
        Myths about menstruation makes it harder to talk about it, which leads to silence and shame. These are a few myths about periods from around the world.<br>

      “You can't enter the kitchen, or cook food."<br> “You can't enter a place of worship.”<br> “You need to wash your pads before throwing them out, otherwise you will attract evil spirits.”<br> “Tampons will break your hymen and make you impure”

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Recent surveys by Plan International have shown that 50% of those who have periods have experienced financial difficulties in accessing sanitary products. A striking 61% have missed school during their period.
            It becomes essential to track and remedy any problem before they get too serious.<strong>We give period products to those who can’t afford them, and provide menstrual education to those less likely to access it. And we help everybody talk about periods.</strong>
           Our mission is to impact period poverty around the globe by improving access to accurate menstrual information and distributing high-quality washable/reusable menstrual hygiene products. We are motivated by the belief that those who menstruate should do so with comfort and in dignity.

                  <strong>Yes</strong>. Research has shown there is a direct connection between period poverty, poor quality of life, and poor mental health. When people can’t manage their periods safely and with dignity, it can take a toll on them physically, and mentally, increasing feelings of shame and embarrassment

                    There isn’t a single solution to solving period poverty, but activists, the private and public sectors, and individuals can come together to help tackle the issue in several ways. Engaging boys and girls in education and everyday conversations that normalize menstruation is key to ending taboos around the natural process, advocates say. Governments must also support policies that ensure everyone has access to the resources and information they need to manage their periods and prioritize menstrual hygiene in COVID-19 relief efforts.

                    Lack of access to the right menstrual products may lead to greater risk of infection. For example, some studies show that, in locations with high humidity, reusable pads may not dry thoroughly, possibly contributing to infection risks.

                    In some cases, women and girls do not have access to menstrual products at all. They may resort to rags, leaves, newspaper or other makeshift items to absorb or collect menstrual blood. They may also be prone to leaks, contributing to shame or embarrassment.

                    Our mission is to end period poverty and ensure that all women have unrestricted access to sanitary items. We do this through the donation and distribution of period products including pads, maternity pads, incontinence pads, new reusable pads, tampons, period-proof underwear and menstrual cups. Any donations must be brand new, still sealed in their original packaging and must comply with Australian quality standards. We do this because no woman should have to choose between a tampon and a meal.
